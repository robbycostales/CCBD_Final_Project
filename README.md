# CCBD_Final_Project

Overview:
Our projectâ€™s mission is to create an application that assists students with note taking, particularly those with hearing-related disabilities. The core functionality of this app is to record lecture notes and translate audio input into text that can then be bookmarked, commented on, and potentially manipulated by the student in other ways as well. The desired audience would be all students, but can be used in a broader sense.  We will first start off with a feature to upload saved audio files to then analyze and convert to text. With time permitting, we will try to create real time analytics.
